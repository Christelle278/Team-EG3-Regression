Renewable Energy Shortfall Modeling Project Readme
Project Overview
The aim of this project is to model the daily energy shortfall between the energy generated by fossil fuels and various renewable sources in Spain. The daily shortfall, which is the target variable, will be modeled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as pressure, wind speed, humidity, and more.

Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a regression model that predicts the daily energy shortfall in Spain based on the provided weather and city-specific data.

Project Deliverables
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables as necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct EDA to understand the relationships between weather features, energy generation, and the energy shortfall.

Feature Engineering:

Create new features if necessary and select relevant features for modeling.

Model Building:

Develop and train a regression model to predict the daily energy shortfall using the selected features.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared.

Model Deployment:

Deploy the trained model for making predictions on new data.

Documentation:

Create documentation that explains the data, methodology, and model for future reference.

Project Timeline

The project will be conducted in phases, with each phase having specific tasks and deadlines. The timeline for the project will be determined by the project manager in consultation with the team members.

Data Volume

The dataset contains nearly 8762 rows, and its size may impact data processing and model training times. Appropriate hardware and software resources will be allocated to handle this volume effectively.

Collaboration
The project team will collaborate closely to ensure the successful completion of each phase. Communication channels will be established to facilitate teamwork and knowledge sharing.

Conclusion

The successful modeling of the daily energy shortfall in Spain will provide valuable insights for the government's renewable energy infrastructure investments, contributing to a more sustainable and reliable energy supply for the citizens.
